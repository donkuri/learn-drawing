# Introductory remarks

## What is this?

This website aims to catalog and discuss a variety of resources (mostly books) to learn how to draw. Resources are mainly in two languages: English and Japanese. For the Japanese resources, I assume you can read Japanese (or at least have something like [Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/)) to help you understand. 

There are two parts. The first one discusses books that teach you how to draw, the second one is my some of my favorite artists with one or multiple of their artbooks. My hope is that everyone can learn from these, but they are also tailored to my own personal preferences. I'm very much in the process of learning how to draw as well so I have also asked other artists I know to comment on the books they know about. I do not claim expertise in the same way that I do on the [Mathematics](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-mathematics/) and [Japanese](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/) learning websites. If that bothers you, feel free to disregard my comments on the books and just use this website as a catalog and gallery.

## What is required to do this?

Some time and a tendency for self-care. Learning anything is hard but art is a particularly long journey. I believe it was Steve Huston that said something along the lines of "Artists often hit their strides in their sixties." He's right. It's a marathon, not a race, so take it one step at a time. 千里の道も一歩から。Other than this, the rest doesn't matter, including your age.

## Who is this for?

Anyone with even a passing interest in learning how to draw.

## How do I learn to draw?

First, I would learn about setting up (micro)habits. I also heavily suggest reading [Good Habits, Bad Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Habits-Bad-Science-Positive/dp/1250159075) which is where I learned how to build habits for the long term. This is what I would consider "metacognition", by which I mean actively thinking about your learning process. Needless to say, I would rather you spent thirty minutes each day drawing then having only one day in the week where you draw for four hours, but not everyone has the same time available. 

Once you have decided how much time you want to set aside for art every week or every day, here is the routine I would follow. I suggest you start your drawing sessions by warming up, and the way I warm up is by doing gesture drawing. Usually for me that will be quick poses, between thirty seconds and a minute. I also like to draw a few basic forms, such as straight lines, curved lines, circles, ellipses, spheres, and boxes. After this, it's the main topic or drawing of the day. At the end, I like to do some free stuff. That can be anything: copying a drawing I like, laying some tracing paper over an old master study and drawing the majors forms, starting a new original piece, watching a tutorial on a specific thing I struggle with, etc.

The topic of feedback tends to be sensitive in my experience. Most artists I know tend to be very wary of both receiving and giving criticism, even if it is constructive and candid. This might be because a lot of artists tend to identify very strongly with their art, which makes it a sensitive topic. Not to mention, improvement takes a very long time, something that people tend not to realize upfront. I urge you to stay open-minded and to look for harsh yet constructive criticism that will help you to grow. 

I would like to bring your attention to the following: The better your eye gets, the more you will see problems in your art. The more you will see problems in your art, the more you will think that you suck. This can either lead to you wanting to learn more, or it can lead to despair and giving up. As such, be aware that when you seem to hit plateaus in your art journey, it might just be your eye that got better and you are now noticing issues that were invisible to you before. This does not mean you stopped progressing, it just means your skill now has to play catch up with your eye. Some people start with a fantastic eye, some people start with a poor eye. Both will have to improve significantly either way, so there's no point in comparing. 

In turn, when you seem to be progressing really fast, keep in mind that at some point your eye will inevitably get even better and you might start thinking you suck again. To avoid this issue, keep all your old drawings and periodically take a quick glance at them. That's a great way to remind you of where you were. But remember one of the two requirements I mentioned above. A tendency to self-care is important. Don't beat yourself up too much because you suck. Even great artists think they suck. It takes a long, long time not to suck. Just embrace the journey. If you play your cards right, it might last you a lifetime or two.

Finally, I would advise against spending all your time studying. Chess masters spend years doing tactics to sharpen their skill and vision, similarly artists need to draw every day. This is the most important thing and if you’re going to retain anything from this introduction, let it be this. If you want to learn how to draw, draw; preferably, a lot. Even if it’s not perfect, try to keep drawing. Drawing is not a spectator sport. You can read every single book in this list, watch every single video and still not know how to draw. Draftsmanship and line quality matter a lot so get drawing.

## Do I need to draw traditionally?

Up to you honestly. When it comes to rendering, I would do it on your preferred medium because it is pretty different. I like to do studies with a pencil and some nice paper but you can also do everything digitally.

## Why did you not include this resource?

Probably because I am not aware of it.

# Part I: Learning to Draw

In this part, I would like to discuss resources to help you learn what you will need in order to draw well. This can range from the so-called art fundamentals (or "fundies") to more specific topics. While I have not tried to rate the resources in terms of difficulty, I have ordered them in the way I intend to use them. In general, I would recommend anyone to start with construction however, because it is the most fundamental of fundamentals along with observation, two fundies that are often paired together anyway. I personally learn better from books than from video courses, so I will add the courses at the end of each topic.

I don't believe you should go through every single book in order in every topic before moving on. Some books go much deeper or require more background to truly appreciate (looking at you, Bridgman!) and thus are better left for later. I have resisted the temptation to label what resources is for what level because I think you should get a feel for it yourself. After all, what I consider to be more difficult might be more adapted to you, or you might just like it better than some other resources. Still, here are two recommendations. First, do construction first, and keep working on it every day. Second, learn and get good at using light values before you completely dive in color studies. Getting the wrong hue or chroma does not do as much damage to a drawing as getting the wrong values in my opinion, provided that is not an artistic choice on your part.

With this out of the way, let's start.

## Construction

Construction is the process through which you use simple forms to simplify and represent reality. This requires two things: being able to see things for what they are and learning what shapes can simplify yet retain the essence of what you're drawing, what Steve Huston calls "simple yet characteristic" forms. This should be the first step you take towards learning how to draw and proper construction creates a three-dimensional look to your drawing. Of course, a two-dimensional look is cool too and was very popular in various places and at various periods of human history, but this is not what we're aiming for right now. Better to be able to do both 2D and 3D than to only be able to do 2D.

#### Books

**[Keys to Drawing](https://www.amazon.com/Keys-Drawing-Bert-Dodson/dp/0891343377)**, *Bert Dodson*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/dodson.jpg" alt="Keys to Drawing" width="200px"/>

A classic, somewhat old school introduction to observation and construction. Personally, I found it had slightly too much text for my liking, but the advice in there is pretty good so it's fair enough. It's also pretty gentle, so it's a good first introduction if you're somewhat scared of learning how to draw. Some of the exercises were particularly interesting, but I ended up looking for something else.

**[The Art and Science of Drawing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1681987759?)**, *Brent Eviston*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/eviston.jpg" alt="Eviston" width="200px"/>

That's my preferred book for learning construction. The book is pretty complete. Eviston is a great artist (those birds!) and he teaches well in my opinion. His explanations of things like mark making and measuring were well suited to complete beginners and I felt like I learned a lot. Greatly recommended.

**[Fun with a Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Pencil-Everybody-Easily-Learn/dp/0857687603)**, *Andrew Loomis*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/fwap.jpg" alt="FWAP" width="200px"/>¨

The classic recommendation! Loomis is one of the most well known art instructor for a good reason. Fun with a Pencil is perhaps his most accessible work (at least from those I have seen and listed here), although the presentation is very dated which might deter some. His approach to drawing heads is now standard and very often taught (sometimes in a slightly modified form) as _the_ construction method for heads. He studied under Bridgman (along with other popular artists such as Norman Rockwell) and it shows. This is the first book I tried to read when I first tried learning how to draw, but the language and style somewhat put me off.

#### Courses

**[Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/)**, *Irshad Karim*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/drawabox.jpg" alt="Drawabox" width="200px"/>

Perhaps the most well-known free art course available right now, Drawabox aims to teach you observation and construction in seven lessons and a few challenges along the way (such as the famous "250 boxes" one). It's free so I can't complain much, not to mention it's pretty good. Personally, I only did the first part and the challenges because afterwards I went to Eviston's book, but I'm sure the rest is good too. The community is a highlight too.

**[Dynamic Sketching I](https://www.cgmasteracademy.com/courses/66-dynamic-sketching-1.html)**, *Peter Han*

Drawabox was created based on this course by Peter Han, so it tackles the same topic. In my opinion, this is harder than Drawabox because it doesn't your hand as much, but at the same time, the two people I know that went through the course seem to have actually learned a whole lot from it, so it's worth checking out at the very least. If you feel like Drawabox is too verbose or too boring, maybe try it out.

## Figure Drawing

Figure drawing is a huge field in its own right, so it's a bit silly to categorize it as one single thing but here I specifically mean books and courses that allow you to get a grip on the proportions of the human body and how to simplify it in a way that retains its most essential elements. This is not about anatomy where we study specific muscle insertions and so on. Here, gesture is king.

#### Books

**[Figure Drawing for Artists](https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-Artists-Making-Every/dp/1631590650)**, *Steve Huston*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/huston.jpg" alt="Huston" width="200px"/>

Steve Huston's Figure Drawing for Artists is my favorite drawing book. In there, Steve analyzes his own works (which by the way, breathtaking) as well as old masters (notably Boucher) to understand the two main tools that support figure drawing: structure and gesture. His explanations are crystal clear and his drawings are drop-dead gorgeous, full of life and interesting to analyze. The second part is more about anatomy, and there is a chapter on light. I think everyone should read the first few chapters at least.

**[Figure Drawing: Design and Invention](https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-Invention-Michael-Hampton/dp/0615272819/)**, *Michael Hampton*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/hampton.jpg" alt="Hampton" width="200px"/>

What a fantastic book. Hampton simplifies the human body in just the right way in my opinion. To properly learn from it, you should copy the drawings in there (as you often should) but unlike some other books, the text is actually worth reading as well. Hampton's explanation of asymmetry in the human body (as in classical contrapposto, for instance) really stuck with me. The second part of the book has more to do with anatomy, but the first part is exceptional.

**[Figure Drawing for All It's Worth](https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-All-Its-Worth/dp/0857680986)**, *Andrew Loomis*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/FDFAIW.jpg" alt="FDFAIW" width="200px"/>

Probably the most famous of all Loomis books, this one is a clear step up from Fun with a Pencil. It tackles the human body in all its glory. Similarly to Fun with a Pencil, the style is a bit dated and many people do not really like the explanations. Personally, I would probably just skim through the explanations and spend most of my time copying it instead, but some other people might benefit from the explanations.

**[Vilppu Drawing Manual](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Glenn-Vilppu-ebook/dp/B0FCV5BK8M)**, *Glenn Vilppu*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/vilppu.jpg" alt="Vilppu" width="200px"/>

A classic treatise on figure drawing by one of the world's foremost animator who worked for years teaching at Disney. I'll be honest, I have only skimmed this book briefly but it consistently gets such high praises (and Vilppu as an instructor as well) that I thought it would be a disservice not to mention it. This is a "digitally enhanced" edition, whatever that might mean, but I saw pages from the original.

**[Drawing the Female Figure](https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Female-Figure-Hentai-Artists/dp/1912740133)**, *Hikaru Hayashi*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/hayashi.jpg" alt="Hayashi" width="200px"/>

Hikaru Hayashi is a pretty well-known in the world of English books teaching you how to draw in a manga or anime kind of style. This is the only book I have seen from him but it is absolutely fantastic and it does not shy away from risqué angles and such (as is obvious from the extended title). Most of it is pretty good though I have seen one or two drawings that I thought were off here and there, so don't just copy mindlessly, try to understand why he does the simplifications you see. Good introduction to drawing cute anime girls, basically.

**[アタリ練習帳](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%81%A9%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%82%82%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E3%82%88%E3%81%86%E3%81%AB%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A2%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E7%B7%B4%E7%BF%92%E5%B8%B3-%E8%A5%BF%E6%9D%B1%E7%A4%BE%E7%B7%A8%E9%9B%86%E9%83%A8/dp/4791627970/355-3254362-7590161)**, *西東社*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/atari.jpg" alt="" width="200px"/>

Tremendous book focusing on アタリ, the rough drawing of the pose before you start putting the muscles and so on. Includes a wide variety of poses that are broken down in four distinct steps, from アタリ to finished drawings. Highly recommended.

**[人物作画テクニック](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/超技巧-人物作画テクニック-ディテールから見えてくる、本当の線の捉え方-toshi/dp/4295200328/355-3254362-7590161)**, *toshi*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/jinbutsusakuga.jpg" alt="" width="200px"/>

A variety of techniques to draw the human body from one of my favorite art teachers, toshi. This is a mixed bag of tips about perspective, specific body parts and more general things so it does not fit neatly in one category. Since it's all about drawing the human body, I decided to put it in this category.

**[マンガキャラの描き方超入門](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%A6%E3%82%82%E3%82%89%E3%81%84%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8F%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%81%AE%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%8D%E6%96%B9%E8%B6%85%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-KawaiiSensei/dp/4415332781)**, *KawaiiSensei*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kawaiisensei.jpg" alt="" width="200px"/>

A pretty gentle introduction to drawing characters in a manga style, mostly by translating real life pictures into anime-style characters. Again, this could be placed elsewhere since it also discusses the head, but considering the amount of time spent on the human figure and the various poses, I think it fits right here. I like this book.

**[神技作画](https://www.amazon.co.jp//Manabu-Kamiwaza-Learning-Techniques-Scratch/dp/4046015039)**, *toshi*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kamiwaza.jpg" alt="" width="200px"/>

Another book by toshi which first tackles a variety of important questions and struggles in a Q&A. Once again, a book that touches on a variety of subjects that might also be classified elsewhere (for instance shadows and such). Worth getting after you have some experience with drawing アタリ and such.

**[キャラ作画のコツ160](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/TACO%E7%9B%B4%E4%BC%9D%EF%BC%81-%E3%81%82%E3%82%89%E3%82%86%E3%82%8B%E6%82%A9%E3%81%BF%E3%82%92%E8%A7%A3%E6%B1%BA%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%BB%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%84160-TACO%EF%BC%88%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B3%EF%BC%89/dp/4756257690)**, *TACO*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kotsu1.jpg" alt="Kotsu-1" width="200px"/>

This book along with the next discuss コツ, various tips and tricks for drawing stuff. Most of it is related to the human body, but if I get enough books of this category, I will create a new category for it. This one is for character illustrations in general.

**[人体ドローイングのコツ390](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/TACO%E7%9B%B4%E4%BC%9D%EF%BC%81-%E7%9F%A5%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%82%8B%E3%81%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%A7%E5%8A%87%E7%9A%84%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%94%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B-%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%93%E3%83%89%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%84390-TACO%EF%BC%88%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B3%EF%BC%89/dp/4756256880)**, *TACO*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kotsu2.jpg" alt="Kotsu-2" width="200px"/>

This is the second book and focuses specifically on 人体ドローイング as the title implies.

#### Courses

**[Proko's Figure Drawing Course](https://www.proko.com/course/figure-drawing-fundamentals)**, *Stan Prokopenko*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/prokofigure.jpeg" alt="ProkoFD" width="200px"/>

Stan Prokopenko is perhaps YouTube's most well-known art instructor. His figure drawing course is well-constructed and pretty good, though not everyone can stand Proko's antics. Personally, I don't really mind, but I remember one of my friend getting pretty tired of it when she was going through the anatomy course. If you prefer watching rather than reading, this is really good.

**[hide channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hidechannel2)**

It's hard not to recommend this YouTube channel considering they're by far my favorite Japanese art instructor on YouTube. Has a lot of tutorials on figure drawing, my favorite being [this video on クロッキー](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Ej9EIlfoc).

## Light and Color

Light and color are often packaged together because, well, color can also be perceived through light. This is also where shadows, i.e. the partial (or total) absence of light, usually is treated.

#### Books

**[Light for Visual Artists](https://www.amazon.com/Light-Visual-Artists-Second-Understanding/dp/1786274515)**, *Richard Yot*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/yot.jpg" alt="Yot" width="200px"/>

An introduction to using light in visual arts. It is thus not just aimed at illustrators, but the explanations are quite clear and not too overly technical in my opinion.
