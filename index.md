# Introductory remarks

## What is this?

This website aims to catalog and discuss a variety of resources (mostly books) to learn how to draw. Resources are mainly in two languages: English and Japanese. For the Japanese resources, I assume you can read Japanese (or at least have something like [Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/)) to help you understand. 

There are multiple parts. The first part discusses drawing foundations. Those are skills that will be useful no matter what you draw and include construction, perspective, light and color as well as composition. The second part focuses on the human body, discussing figure drawing and anatomy. The third part is on design, including character design, clothes design and environment design. My hope is that everyone can learn from these, but they are also tailored to my own personal preferences. I'm very much in the process of learning how to draw as well so I have also asked other artists I know to comment on the books they know about. I do not claim expertise in the same way that I do on the [Mathematics](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-mathematics/) and [Japanese](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/) learning websites. If that bothers you, feel free to disregard my comments on the books and just use this website as a catalog and gallery.

## What is required to do this?

Some time and a tendency for self-care. Learning anything is hard but art is a particularly long journey. I believe it was Steve Huston that said something along the lines of "Artists often hit their strides in their sixties." He's right. It's a marathon, not a race, so take it one step at a time. 千里の道も一歩から。Other than this, the rest doesn't matter, including your age.

## Who is this for?

Anyone with even a passing interest in learning how to draw.

## How do I learn to draw?

First, I would learn about setting up (micro)habits. I also heavily suggest reading [Good Habits, Bad Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Habits-Bad-Science-Positive/dp/1250159075) which is where I learned how to build habits for the long term. This is what I would consider "metacognition", by which I mean actively thinking about your learning process. Needless to say, I would rather you spent thirty minutes each day drawing then having only one day in the week where you draw for four hours, but not everyone has the same time available. 

Once you have decided how much time you want to set aside for art every week or every day, here is the routine I would follow. I suggest you start your drawing sessions by warming up, and the way I warm up is by doing gesture drawing. Usually for me that will be quick poses, between thirty seconds and a minute. I also like to draw a few basic forms, such as straight lines, curved lines, circles, ellipses, spheres, and boxes. After this, it's the main topic or drawing of the day. At the end, I like to do some free stuff. That can be anything: copying a drawing I like, laying some tracing paper over an old master study and drawing the majors forms, starting a new original piece, watching a tutorial on a specific thing I struggle with, etc.

The topic of feedback tends to be sensitive in my experience. Most artists I know tend to be very wary of both receiving and giving criticism, even if it is constructive and candid. This might be because a lot of artists tend to identify very strongly with their art, which makes it a sensitive topic. Not to mention, improvement takes a very long time, something that people tend not to realize upfront. I urge you to stay open-minded and to look for harsh yet constructive criticism that will help you to grow. 

I would like to bring your attention to the following: **The better your eye gets, the more you will see problems in your art. The more you will see problems in your art, the more you will think that you suck.** This can either lead to you wanting to learn more, or it can lead to despair and giving up. As such, be aware that when you seem to hit plateaus in your art journey, it might just be your eye that got better and you are now noticing issues that were invisible to you before. This does not mean you stopped progressing, it just means your skill now has to play catch up with your eye. Some people start with a fantastic eye, some people start with a poor eye. Both will have to improve significantly either way, so there's no point in comparing. 

In turn, when you seem to be progressing really fast, keep in mind that at some point your eye will inevitably get even better and you might start thinking you suck again. To avoid this issue, keep all your old drawings and periodically take a quick glance at them. That's a great way to remind you of where you were. But remember one of the two requirements I mentioned above. A tendency to self-care is important. Don't beat yourself up too much because you suck. Even great artists think they suck. It takes a long, long time not to suck. Just embrace the journey. If you play your cards right, it might last you a lifetime or two.

Finally, I would advise against spending all your time studying. Chess masters spend years actually solving tactics to sharpen their skill and vision, similarly artists need to draw every day. This is the most important thing and if you’re going to retain anything from this introduction, let it be this. If you want to learn how to draw, draw; preferably, a lot. Even if it’s not perfect, keep drawing. Drawing is not a spectator sport. You can read every single book in this list, watch every single video and still not know how to draw. Draftsmanship and line quality matter a lot so get drawing.

## Do I need to draw traditionally?

Up to you honestly. When it comes to rendering, I would do it on your preferred medium because it is pretty different. I like to do studies with a pencil and some nice paper but you can also do everything digitally.

## Why did you not include this resource?

Probably because I am not aware of it. If I am aware of it, I haven't had the chance to see or use it myself, nor do I know someone close that did and can provide earnest feedback.

## There are so many resources!

I don't believe you should go through every single book in order in every topic before moving on. Some books go much deeper or require more background to truly appreciate (looking at you, Bridgman!) and thus are better left for later. I have resisted the temptation to label what resources is for what level because I think you should get a feel for it yourself. After all, what I consider to be more difficult might be more adapted to you, or you might just like it better than some other resources. Still, here are two recommendations. First, do construction first, and keep working on it every day. Second, learn and get good at using light values before you completely dive in color studies. Getting the wrong hue or chroma does not do as much damage to a drawing as getting the wrong values in my opinion, provided that is not an artistic choice on your part. In the last part, I will show a potential learning order you can follow if you'd rather do that.

# Part I: Foundations

In this part, I would like to discuss resources to help you learn what you will need in order to draw well in a variety of situations. These usually comprise of drawing fundamentals (often called "fundies"). While I have not tried to rate the resources in terms of difficulty, I have ordered them in the way I intend to use them. In general, I would recommend anyone to start with construction however, because it is the most fundamental of fundamentals along with observation, two fundies that are often paired together anyway. I personally learn better from books than from video courses, so I will add the courses at the end of each topic.

With this out of the way, let's start.

## Construction

Construction is the process through which you use simple forms to simplify and represent reality. This requires two things: being able to see things for what they are and learning what shapes can simplify yet retain the essence of what you're drawing, what Steve Huston calls "simple yet characteristic" forms. This should be the first step you take towards learning how to draw and proper construction creates a three-dimensional look to your drawing. Of course, a two-dimensional look is cool too and was very popular in various places and at various periods of human history, but this is not what we're aiming for right now. Better to be able to do both 2D and 3D than to only be able to do 2D.

#### Books

**[Keys to Drawing](https://www.amazon.com/Keys-Drawing-Bert-Dodson/dp/0891343377)**, *Bert Dodson*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/dodson.jpg" alt="Keys to Drawing" width="280px"/>

A classic, somewhat old school introduction to observation and construction. Personally, I found it had slightly too much text for my liking, but the advice in there is pretty good so it's fair enough. It's also pretty gentle, so it's a good first introduction if you're somewhat scared of learning how to draw. Some of the exercises were particularly interesting, but I ended up looking for something else.

**[The Art and Science of Drawing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1681987759?)**, *Brent Eviston*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/eviston.jpg" alt="Eviston" width="280px"/>

That's my preferred book for learning construction. The book is pretty complete. Eviston is a great artist (those birds!) and he teaches well in my opinion. His explanations of things like mark making and measuring were well suited to complete beginners and I felt like I learned a lot. Greatly recommended.

**[Fun with a Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Pencil-Everybody-Easily-Learn/dp/0857687603)**, *Andrew Loomis*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/fwap.jpg" alt="FWAP" width="280px"/>

The classic recommendation! Loomis is one of the most well known art instructor for a good reason. Fun with a Pencil is perhaps his most accessible work (at least from those I have seen and listed here), although the presentation is very dated which might deter some. His approach to drawing heads is now standard and very often taught (sometimes in a slightly modified form) as _the_ construction method for heads. He studied under Bridgman (along with other popular artists such as Norman Rockwell) and it shows. This is the first book I tried to read when I first tried learning how to draw, but the language and style somewhat put me off.

#### Courses

**[Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/)**, *Irshad Karim*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/drawabox.jpg" alt="Drawabox" width="280px"/>

Perhaps the most well-known free art course available right now, Drawabox aims to teach you observation and construction in seven lessons and a few challenges along the way (such as the famous "250 boxes" one). It's free so I can't complain much, not to mention it's pretty good. Personally, I only did the first part and the challenges because afterwards I went to Eviston's book, but I'm sure the rest is good too. The community is a highlight too.

**[Dynamic Sketching I](https://www.cgmasteracademy.com/courses/66-dynamic-sketching-1.html)**, *Peter Han*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/han.jpg" alt="Han" width="280px"/>

Drawabox was created based on this course by Peter Han, so it tackles the same topic. In my opinion, this is harder than Drawabox because it doesn't your hand as much, but at the same time, the two people I know that went through the course seem to have actually learned a whole lot from it, so it's worth checking out at the very least. If you feel like Drawabox is too verbose or too boring, maybe try it out.

## Perspective

Perspective is a set of rules developed a while ago to understand how to create a three-dimensional effect on a two-dimensional plane such as a sheet of paper or a computer screen. As such, it helps us understand volumes in space and is an invaluable tool to make our drawings "realistic", whatever that means. It's particularly helpful when drawing complex, urban backgrounds (which just happens to be my favorite thing to draw) but it's also tremendously important for characters, because their construction almost always involves simple forms in space. The way to render these forms realistically is what perspective is about.

#### Books

**[Perspective Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/Perspective-Made-Easy-Dover-Instruction/dp/0486404730)**, *Ernest R. Norling*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/norling.jpg" alt="Norling" width="280px"/>

The first book on perspective I ever read. Actually, I read this even before I wanted to learn how to draw, partially because perspective is quite mathematical in nature, which is my background. Some of my friends thought this was a bit hard, but I think it's just a bit old school. In fact, it's published by Dover which basically prints old books for extremely cheap. Honestly, I like it a lot but I guess some people would prefer something a bit more modern-looking.

**[Framed Perspective Vol. 1](https://www.amazon.com/Framed-Perspective-Vol-Technical-Storytelling/dp/1624650309)**, *Marcos Mateu-Mestre*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/mmm1.jpg" alt="mmm1" width="280px"/>

My personal recommendation for people interested in learning perspective as it relates to characters. In general, the explanations are cool with beautiful drawings that really make you want to dig more into it. Because of my mathematics background, I prefer something more formal like the book below but I would still recommend this to just about anyone. 

**[How to Draw](https://www.amazon.com/How-Draw-sketching-environments-imagination/dp/1933492732)**, *Scott Robertson*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/scott1.jpg" alt="Scott1" width="280px"/>

Now that's the stuff. If you're serious about perspective, you should study from this book. If you're not serious about perspective, you should also study from this book. This is Robertson's fantastic first book in the "How to" series which deals with perspective, from the very basics to the advanced stuff. The final chapters are kind of like the final sections of Drawabox on steroids. It's a tough but worthwhile read that will help you tremendously to understand space and volume. My favorite part is the perspective grid chapter.

**[パースのレッスン](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%81%84%E3%81%A1%E3%81%B0%E3%82%93%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%81%AD%E3%81%84%E3%81%AA%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AE%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%82%B9%E3%83%B3-%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B8%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AB%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AE%E3%81%84%E3%81%84%E7%B5%B5%E3%81%8C%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E6%9C%AC-Susie%EF%BC%88%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%BC%EF%BC%89/dp/4815633517)**, *Susie*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/susie.jpg" alt="Susie" width="280px"/>

A very recent textbook on perspective that I found on the top shelves of Maruzen a bit ago and couldn't stop checking out. Usually when that happens it means I have to buy the book, and I regret not doing it. That being said, I did spend some time flipping through it and I thought it was extremely well made. The explanations were clear and the organisation itself was nice.

**[Perspective and Depth](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Master-Perspective-Mike-Hernandez/dp/1912843838)**, *3dtotal Publishing*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/3dtotal2.jpg" alt="3dtotal2" width="280px"/>

Full disclosure I have not read this book yet, although I plan to buy it soon. So why is it here? Because this is in the "Artists' Master Series" and their first book on Color and Light was so good that I expect them not to disappoint with the other books they put out. But this is tentative, if it sucks when I get it, I'll take it out of here. This also holds for their book on composition which will come later.

#### Courses

**[How to draw (the) human body in perspective & others](https://krenzcushart.gumroad.com/l/cRkSh?layout=profile)**, *Krenz Cushart*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/krenz.jpg" alt="Krenz" width="280px"/>

Krenz is a master although his stuff is sometimes hard to understand. Still, he's such a good artist and this advanced tutorial is really useful to applying perspective to your characters.

**[Linear Perspective Master Course](https://www.nma.art/courses/a-complete-guide-to-perspective-for-artists-with-erik-olson/)**, *Erik Olson*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/olson.jpg" alt="Olson" width="280px"/>

This is an extremely comprehensive look at perspective, including some difficult topics. I highly recommend you do not start with this straight up if you haven't seen perspective before because it's a bit overwhelming. Instead, I would use this as a second look, at the same time or replacing Scott Robertson's How to Draw.

## Color and Light

Color and light are often packaged together because, well, color is perceived through light. This is also where shadows, i.e. the partial (or total) absence of light, usually get treated.

#### Books

**[Light for Visual Artists](https://www.amazon.com/Light-Visual-Artists-Second-Understanding/dp/1786274515)**, *Richard Yot*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/yot.jpg" alt="Yot" width="280px"/>

An introduction to using light in visual arts. It is thus not just aimed at illustrators, but the explanations are quite clear and not too overly technical in my opinion. Still, I sometimes find it a bit hard to apply, personally.

**[Artists's Master Series: Color and Light](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Master-Color-3dtotal-Publishing/dp/1912843412)**, *3dtotal Publishing*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/3dtotal.jpg" alt="3dtotal" width="280px"/>

This book is a part of 3dtotal Publishing's line-up and focuses first on color and then on light, splitting the subject in three different parts. I think this has my favorite explanations and is the perfect reference book. And I mean, any book that has Guweiz, Djamila Knopf and Nathan Fowkes is bound to be phenomenal. Highly recommended.

**[ライティングの教科書](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%83%90%E3%83%8B%E3%83%AA%E3%82%BE-ebook/dp/B0DDS5VSNP)**, *バニリゾ*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/lighting.jpg" alt="Lighting" width="280px"/>

Now that is the book I would pick up for understanding light on (anime) characters. The way it breaks down the various parts of the body and how they react to light (and more importantly, shadow) is a real highlight (pun intended). In particular, chapters 4 and 5 focus on コツ which I found pretty useful.

**[影指定ワークブック](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/YURIKO-ebook/dp/B0FP4MYNP2/356-0896065-3452744)**, *YURIKO*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/yuriko.jpg" alt="Yuriko" width="280px"/>

Very cute book. Basically, it's a workbook that teaches you where to put shadows in your anime drawings. I would use this either as an introduction to shadows and light to get convincing illustrations quickly, or after you actually understand how these things work to see how they're put into practice in anime-style drawings.

**[Color and Light](https://www.amazon.com/Color-Light-Realist-Painter-Gurney/dp/0740797719)**, *James Gurney*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/gurney.jpg" alt="" width="280px"/>

Ok, ok, I know this is what you were all expecting. James Gurney is a fantastic artist and I'm sure his books are fantastic, but to be honest I consider this to be a bit above my paygrade for the moment. It's here as a reference and I _will_ come back to it, but for now I can't say much other than everyone seems to be praising this book, so it has to be good, right? Anyway, I would probably use this as a second look at color and light, but maybe it's just me. Anyway, he also has another famous book named [Imaginative Realism](https://www.amazon.com/Imaginative-Realism-Paint-Doesnt-Gurney/dp/0740785508/142-9456114-2752317?pd_rd_w=98oZH&content-id=amzn1.sym.2aec5a0f-72e8-4d2b-85c5-8e0dd71765ff&pf_rd_p=2aec5a0f-72e8-4d2b-85c5-8e0dd71765ff&pf_rd_r=ECFHWJT9ECFTHW7X8WK9&pd_rd_wg=7IMI2&pd_rd_r=0f4dffa5-42bc-4952-ab0e-97a942799e2d&pd_rd_i=0740785508&psc=1), although I don't know anything about it.

**[光と色のチュートリアル](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%85%89%E3%81%A8%E8%89%B2%E3%81%AE%E3%83%81%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB-%E3%83%91%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%AA%E3%83%8E/dp/4837308201)**, *Rino Park*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/paku1.jpg" alt="Paku1" width="280px"/>

This book is part of a whole series of tutorials that were translated in Japanese. The author is a fantastic Korean illustrator whose work I encourage you to check out. I haven't touched this one much but it reminds me a lot of the other ライティング book I mentioned above. Apparently, there is a version on coloring in the same series called [色塗りチュートリアル](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E8%89%B2%E5%A1%97%E3%82%8A%E3%83%81%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB-%E7%AB%8B%E4%BD%93%E6%84%9F%E3%81%AE%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%92%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%93%E3%81%86-%E3%83%91%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%AA%E3%83%8E/dp/4837308155). I don't know about it, but I heard it was slightly easier.

**[モノクロイラストテクニック](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/jaco-ebook/dp/B07KJ9ST18)**, *jaco*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/jack.jpg" alt="Jaco" width="280px"/>

A great book by a fantastic author that focuses on monochromatic drawing techniques. One might argue this fits better under figure drawing or whatever, but the focus is on shading and monochromatic techniques so I've decided to put it here. If you want to see what the author's work looks like, check [this book](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/jaco-ebook/dp/B09CTSXK9N) out.

**[Framed Perspective Vol.2](https://www.amazon.com/Framed-Perspective-Vol-Technical-Characters/dp/1624650325)**, *Marcos Mateu-Mestre*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/mmm2.jpg" alt="FPvol2" width="280px"/>

This is the follow-up book to Marcos Mateu-Mestre's other very famous book Framed Perspective Vol.1 which we saw before. This second book aims to help you draw shadows in perspective. If you liked the first one, I recommend looking at this one too.

**[How to Render](https://www.amazon.com/How-Render-fundamentals-shadow-reflectivity/dp/1933492961)**, *Scott Robertson*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/scott2.jpg" alt="Scott2" width="280px"/>

This is Robertson's second book in the "How to" series, building on the first book about perspective we saw before. If you loved the first one, you're likely to also like this one. I consider this to be the final say on rendering just about anything and it's more of a reference for me currently, though the explanations are surprisingly understandable. I genuinely think any artist should study this book cover to cover at some point. I know I will.

#### Courses

**[Foundations of Light and Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q-LZVFZuGE&list=PLV2X3tgajVlHkH3FHxm3rLZWqScFTRhtv)**, *Sycra*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/sycra.jpg" alt="Sycra" width="280px"/>

A great introduction to the principles of light in an accessible YouTube video course format. Great stuff.

## Composition

In essence, composition is the organization of all visual elements in your piece to get an esthetically pleasing arrangement. In my experience, it tends to be the most neglected of all art fundamentals (including by yours truly), perhaps because people tend to think that is somewhat arbitrary. Well, I am here to tell you it is not, at least not entirely. There are a variety of well-known rules (such as the rule of thirds) which tend to produce certain effects on the viewer. This is what the books and courses below are all about.

#### Books

**[Framed Ink](https://www.amazon.com/Framed-Ink-Drawing-Composition-Storytellers/dp/1933492953)**, *Marcos Mateu-Mestre*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/mmm3.jpg" alt="mmm3" width="280px"/>

Probably Marcos Mateu-Mestre's most famous book, Framed Ink is a great explanation of the basic principles of composition in the context of visual storytelling, e.g. comics or manga. This is my favorite composition book, period. Highly recommended.

**[Artists' Master Series: Composition and Narrative](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Master-Composition-Narrative-Masters/dp/1912843595)**, *3dtotal Publishing*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/3dtotal3.jpg" alt="3dtotal3" width="280px"/>

Another book by 3dtotal Publishing. Once more, I haven't read this once but considering Nathan Fowkes (see below) is on the team, it has to be absolutely fantastic. From what I have seen, it looks great with a good emphasis on very classic paintings. It might be a good idea to couple it with Framed Ink above to see different perspectives.

**[Framed Ink 2](https://www.amazon.com/Framed-Ink-Format-Composition-Storytellers/dp/1624650538)**, *Marcos Mateu-Mestre*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/mmm4.jpg" alt="mmm4" width="280px"/>

The follow-up to Framed Ink. If you liked the previous entry, you should love this as well. However, this one hits more specific topics so it's probably not as applicable generally. Take a look at what's included and see if you care. If you don't, that's alright.

**[Mastering Composition](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Composition-Techniques-Principles-Dramatically/dp/1581809247)**, *Ian Roberts*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/roberts.jpg" alt="Roberts" width="280px"/>

A pretty well-known composition masterbook for painters. Full disclosure I haven't used it much but friends of mine have warmly recommended it, so I'm putting it there. Feel free to disregard it.

#### Courses

**[Pictorial Composition](https://schoolism.com/courses/concept-art/pictorial-composition-nathan-fowkes)**, *Nathan Fowkes*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/fowkes.jpg" alt="Fowkes" width="280px"/>

This is a masterclass by Nathan Fowkes, a fantastic artist in his own right, now often associated with 3dtotal Publishing. Because it's a course, a lot of it is done live on Photoshop which is really nice. It's a serious course, perhaps I would do Framed Ink first.

**[Elements of Traditional Composition](https://www.nma.art/courses/elements-of-traditional-composition/)**, *Glenn Vilppu*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/vilppu2.jpg" alt="Vilppu2" width="280px"/>

Any class taught by Vilppu is worth taking. In this one, he analyzes the Old Masters and how they used composition to produce specific effects to then show you how to apply it in your own drawings. Cool stuff.

# Part II: The Human Body

This part focuses on drawing the human body from head to toe. Because we are so used to look at human beings, especially their faces, we spot uncanny artifacts extremely quickly. This means that to get a satisfactory look, you will need to practice a lot more than you might expect, in part because the human body is not such a simple shape, though it can be simplified in a variety of interlinked simple shapes. Also, just because it says "Part II" does not mean you have to do the entirety of "Part I" before you start, in fact, I would encourage you to start figure drawing right after construction, but more on this in Part IV.

## Figure Drawing

Figure drawing is a huge field in its own right, so it's a bit silly to categorize it as one single thing but here I specifically mean books and courses that allow you to get a grip on the proportions of the human body and how to simplify it in a way that retains its most essential elements. This is not about anatomy where we study specific muscle insertions and so on. Here, gesture is king.

#### Books

**[Figure Drawing for Artists](https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-Artists-Making-Every/dp/1631590650)**, *Steve Huston*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/huston.jpg" alt="Huston" width="280px"/>

Steve Huston's Figure Drawing for Artists is my favorite art book. In there, Steve analyzes his own works (which by the way, breathtaking) as well as old masters (notably Boucher) to understand the two main tools that support figure drawing: structure and gesture. His explanations are crystal clear and his drawings are drop-dead gorgeous, full of life and interesting to analyze. The second part is more about anatomy, and there is a chapter on light and its absence. I think everyone should read the first few chapters at least.

**[Figure Drawing: Design and Invention](https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-Invention-Michael-Hampton/dp/0615272819/)**, *Michael Hampton*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/hampton.jpg" alt="Hampton" width="280px"/>

What a fantastic book. Hampton simplifies the human body in just the right way in my opinion. To properly learn from it, you should copy the drawings in there (as you often should) but unlike some other books, the text is actually worth reading as well. Hampton's explanation of asymmetry in the human body (as in classical contrapposto, for instance) really stuck with me. The second part of the book has more to do with anatomy, but the first part is exceptional.

**[Figure Drawing for All It's Worth](https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Drawing-All-Its-Worth/dp/0857680986)**, *Andrew Loomis*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/fdfaiw.jpg" alt="FDFAIW" width="280px"/>

Probably the most famous of all Loomis books, this one is a clear step up from Fun with a Pencil. It tackles the human body in all its glory. Similarly to Fun with a Pencil, the style is a bit dated and many people do not really like the explanations. Personally, I would probably just skim through the explanations and spend most of my time copying it instead, but some other people might benefit from the explanations.

**[Vilppu Drawing Manual](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Glenn-Vilppu-ebook/dp/B0FCV5BK8M)**, *Glenn Vilppu*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/vilppu.jpg" alt="Vilppu" width="280px"/>

A classic treatise on figure drawing by one of the world's foremost animator who worked for years teaching at Disney. I'll be honest, I have only skimmed this book briefly but it consistently gets such high praises (and Vilppu as an instructor as well) that I thought it would be a disservice not to mention it. This is a "digitally enhanced" edition, whatever that might mean, but I saw pages from the original.

**[Force: Dynamic Life Drawing for Animators](https://www.amazon.com/Force-Dynamic-Drawing-Animators-Second/dp/0240808452)**, *Mike Mattesi*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/force.jpg" alt="Force" width="280px"/>

A very famous figure drawing book, part of Mike Mattesi's FORCE series that focuses on a dynamic approach to drawing. This one is perhaps the well known of the bunch and for good reason. Particularly useful if you want to become an animator.

**[Drawing the Female Figure](https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Female-Figure-Hentai-Artists/dp/1912740133)**, *Hikaru Hayashi*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/hayashi.jpg" alt="Hayashi" width="280px"/>

Hikaru Hayashi is pretty well-known in the world of English books teaching you how to draw in a manga or anime kind of style. This is the only book I have seen from him but it is absolutely fantastic and it does not shy away from risqué angles and such (as is obvious from the extended title). Most of it is pretty good though I have seen one or two drawings that I thought were off here and there, so don't just copy mindlessly, try to understand why he does the simplifications you see. Good introduction to drawing cute anime girls, basically.

**[アタリ練習帳](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%81%A9%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%82%82%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E3%82%88%E3%81%86%E3%81%AB%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A2%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E7%B7%B4%E7%BF%92%E5%B8%B3-%E8%A5%BF%E6%9D%B1%E7%A4%BE%E7%B7%A8%E9%9B%86%E9%83%A8/dp/4791627970/355-3254362-7590161)**, *西東社*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/atari.jpg" alt="" width="280px"/>

Tremendous book focusing on アタリ, the rough drawing of the pose before you start putting the muscles and so on. Includes a wide variety of poses that are broken down in four distinct steps, from アタリ to finished drawings. Highly recommended.

**[美しい身体の作画ドリル](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%83%95%E3%82%B8%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AF-ebook/dp/B0F9958HFT)**, *フジタク*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/utsukushii.jpg" alt="Utsukushii" width="280px"/>

This one also focuses on the development from the アタリ to the full figure in a few steps. Cool poses in there and there are actual explanations that relate to the way the muscles are attached to the body itself. Good stuff.

**[人物作画テクニック](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/超技巧-人物作画テクニック-ディテールから見えてくる、本当の線の捉え方-toshi/dp/4295200328/355-3254362-7590161)**, *toshi*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/jinbutsusakuga.jpg" alt="" width="280px"/>

A variety of techniques to draw the human body from one of my favorite art teachers, toshi. This is a mixed bag of tips about perspective (see below), specific body parts and more general things so it does not fit neatly in one category. Since it's all about drawing the human body, I decided to put it in this category.

**[マンガキャラの描き方超入門](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%A6%E3%82%82%E3%82%89%E3%81%84%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8F%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E3%81%AE%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%8D%E6%96%B9%E8%B6%85%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-KawaiiSensei/dp/4415332781)**, *KawaiiSensei*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kawaiisensei.jpg" alt="" width="280px"/>

A pretty gentle introduction to drawing characters in a manga style, mostly by translating real life pictures into anime-style characters. Again, this could be placed elsewhere since it also discusses the head, but considering the amount of time spent on the human figure and the various poses, I think it fits right here. I like this book.

**[スーパーマンがデッサン](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%96%B0%E8%A3%85%E7%89%88-%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%83%87%E3%83%83%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3-%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%BB%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AE%E8%80%83%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B%E3%83%87%E3%83%83%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3-%E6%9E%97-%E6%99%83/dp/476613978X)**, *林 晃*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/hayashi2.jpg" alt="Hayashi2" width="280px"/>

Another book by Hikaru Hayashi. This one is more general than his book on the female figure, although the drawings are very similar. I find it more useful as a collection of drawings to copy than as a book to learn from personally.

**[神技作画](https://www.amazon.co.jp//Manabu-Kamiwaza-Learning-Techniques-Scratch/dp/4046015039)**, *toshi*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kamiwaza.jpg" alt="" width="280px"/>

Another book by toshi which first tackles a variety of important questions and struggles in a Q&A. Once again, a book that touches on a variety of subjects that might also be classified elsewhere (for instance shadows and such). Worth getting after you have some experience with drawing アタリ and such.

**[キャラ作画のコツ160](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/TACO%E7%9B%B4%E4%BC%9D%EF%BC%81-%E3%81%82%E3%82%89%E3%82%86%E3%82%8B%E6%82%A9%E3%81%BF%E3%82%92%E8%A7%A3%E6%B1%BA%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%A9%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%BB%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%84160-TACO%EF%BC%88%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B3%EF%BC%89/dp/4756257690)**, *TACO*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kotsu1.jpg" alt="Kotsu-1" width="280px"/>

This book along with the next discuss コツ, various tips and tricks for drawing stuff. Most of it is related to the human body, but if I get enough books of this category, I will create a new category for it. This one is for character illustrations in general.

**[人体ドローイングのコツ390](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/TACO%E7%9B%B4%E4%BC%9D%EF%BC%81-%E7%9F%A5%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%82%8B%E3%81%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%A7%E5%8A%87%E7%9A%84%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%8A%E9%81%94%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B-%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%93%E3%83%89%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%84390-TACO%EF%BC%88%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B3%EF%BC%89/dp/4756256880)**, *TACO*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kotsu2.jpg" alt="Kotsu-2" width="280px"/>

This is the second book and focuses specifically on 人体ドローイング as the title implies.

**[お絵描きチュートリアル](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%81%8A%E7%B5%B5%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%8D%E3%83%81%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB-%E3%83%91%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%AA%E3%83%8E/dp/4837308139)**, *Rino Park*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/paku.jpg" alt="Paku" width="280px"/>

Another book in Rino Park's excellent series of tutorials on drawing. This is an introduction to お絵描き more generally but it focuses on the human body. I have this book and the one on color and light (the one we've mentioned before) but I haven't used it much. Still, it's famous for a reason.

#### Courses

**[Proko's Figure Drawing Course](https://www.proko.com/course/figure-drawing-fundamentals)**, *Stan Prokopenko*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/prokofigure.jpeg" alt="ProkoFD" width="280px"/>

Stan Prokopenko is perhaps YouTube's most well-known art instructor. His figure drawing course is well-constructed and pretty good, though not everyone can stand Proko's antics. Personally, I don't really mind, but I remember one of my friend getting pretty tired of it when she was going through the anatomy course. If you prefer watching rather than reading, this is really good.

**[hide channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hidechannel2)**

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/hide.jpg" alt="Hide Channel" width="280px"/>

It's hard not to recommend this YouTube channel considering they're by far my favorite Japanese art instructor on YouTube. Has a lot of tutorials on figure drawing, my favorite being [this video on クロッキー](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Ej9EIlfoc) which is the thumbnail you see above.

## Posing

By posing, I mean how to approach drawing specific poses ranging from the basic sitting pose to more complex action poses. Here, you will find two types of books. On one hand, textbooks that teach you how to draw certain poses, on the other hand, reference books that have a variety of poses for you to copy and learn from. Just a special note on this, if you have the money and time for it, I highly suggest getting figure drawing classes with a live model. It's a different but worthwhile experience. Other than this, [quickposes](https://quickposes.com/en) is a fantastic online tool to find poses. Usually, I'd use it for gesture drawing.

#### Books

**[ポージングのチュートリアル](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%BB%E3%83%81%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB-%E3%83%91%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%AA%E3%83%8E/dp/4837308163)**, *Rino Park*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/paku3.jpg" alt="Paku2_oops" width="280px"/>

This is another book from Rino Park's famous チュートリアル series. Here, the focus is on how to approach different poses through gesture, anatomy and perspective. As always, if you liked the other books in the series, you will like this one.

**[ポーズの定理](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%8D%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE%E3%82%92%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96%E3%81%A7%E3%81%A4%E3%81%8B%E3%82%80-%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86-%E7%AF%A0%E6%88%BF-%E5%85%AD%E9%83%8E/dp/4048971395)**, *篠房 六郎*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/teiri.jpg" alt="Teiri" width="280px"/>

Another book discussing posing with somewhat of a focus on exaggerated poses for anime girls. Part of what makes this cool is that the author sometimes takes specific poses and shows you how to make them better, often by exaggerating the gesture and making it more dynamic. I haven't used this a lot but it might be a cool reference if you don't like Rino Park's book above. Or maybe not, up to you.

**[キャラポーズの描き方](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/KawaiiSensei-ebook/dp/B0DD6LTMM1)**, *KawaiiSensei*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/kawaiisensei2.jpg" alt="Kawaii" width="280px"/>

Another book by KawaiiSensei, this time focusing on how to draw a variety of poses. I haven't read this one but coming from the author it must be pretty decent. I will probably buy it and report back.

**[アクションポーズ０５あおりモーション](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E7%9E%AC%E6%92%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA05-%E3%81%82%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8A%E3%83%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3-%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E9%AB%98%E7%94%9F%E7%B7%A8-%E6%9D%B1%E5%9C%B0%E5%92%8C%E7%94%9F/dp/4768309674)**, *東地和生, カラサワイサオ*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/action.jpg" alt="Action" width="280px"/>

My favorite reference book for poses, part of a series called アクションポーズ focusing on, well, action poses. This one is about あおりモーション, meaning upshots. It has a lot of really cool, useful poses to copy. It's actually the book I used in conjunction with Huston to learn how to breakdown the body in various simple yet characteristic shapes. Greatly recommended.

**[ポーズの美術解剖学](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E5%8A%A0%E8%97%A4-%E5%85%AC%E5%A4%AA-ebook/dp/B0CFZJS3VD)**, *加藤 公太*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/katou.jpg" alt="Katou" width="280px"/>

Although the title mentions anatomy, really this is more of a very large collection of a variety of poses that have already been simplified somewhat for you. The parts of the body are color coded and streamlined so that you can spend some time copying various poses. I consider this more of a reference book despite what the title claims. If you like this one, consider also [the other book](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E5%8A%A0%E8%97%A4-%E5%85%AC%E5%A4%AA-ebook/dp/B0DLGLL98C) by the same author.

**[おんなのこイラストポーズ集](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E5%B7%9D%E5%8F%A3%E3%82%A4%E3%83%83%E3%82%B5-ebook/dp/B0CW1NQ5NZ/356-0896065-3452744)**, *川口イッサ*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/issa.jpg" alt="Issa" width="280px"/>

A well made collection of a variety of poses focusing on very cute girls, usually in a younger style. Personally I'm more into edgy characters so I don't find it as useful, but maybe you like it. If so, there's a [second book](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E5%B7%9D%E5%8F%A3%E3%82%A4%E3%83%83%E3%82%B5-ebook/dp/B0FQC2ZWG1).

**[とにかくポーズ](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E3%81%84%E3%81%A1%E3%81%82%E3%81%A3%E3%81%B7%E7%B7%A8%E9%9B%86%E9%83%A8-ebook/dp/B0FGJ948JZ)**, *いちあっぷ編集部*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/tonikaku.jpg" alt="Tonikaku" width="280px"/>

A huge collection of poses to learn from. Very varied and once again already simplified. A good reference book to have considering it even has poses with more than one person.

## General Anatomy

Ah, yes, anatomy. For some reason, every beginner artist seems to be obsessed with it. Yes, it's always seemed to me like anatomy was the domain of advanced artists. In general, the main issues that arise with beginning artists have more to do with what I have called before figure drawing, that is to say, correct proportions. This is about the study of individual muscles, how they attach to the body, how they flow, how they form one coherent mass, how we can simplify them. In this section, we tackle general anatomy, that is to say, anatomy for the whole body. The anatomy of specific body parts (e.g. the head) will be discussed below.

**[Basic Human Anatomy](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Human-Anatomy-Essential-Artists/dp/1580934382)**, *Roberto Osti*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/basic.jpg" alt="Basic" width="280px"/>

This is maybe my favorite book on anatomy proper. Osti is a fantastic anatomical artist, the drawings are gorgeous and truly help you better understand the anatomy of the human body without overcomplicating every single muscle. To me, it sits "just right". The stereometric approach proposed in the book is nice to grasp the basics of human anatomy. Highly recommended.

**[Dynamic Human Anatomy](https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Human-Anatomy-Artists-Structure/dp/1580935516)**, *Roberto Osti*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/dynamic.jpg" alt="Dynamic" width="280px"/>

This is the follow-up book, dealing with more dynamic problems in anatomy. If you liked the first volume, you should get this one although it is definitely more advanced due to the nature of dynamic anatomical poses.

**[Anatomy for Sculptors](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Sculptors-Understanding-Human-Figure/dp/1735039020)**, *Uldis Zarins*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/scultpors.jpg" alt="Zarins" width="280px"/>

This fantastic reference is full of extremely detailed anatomical pictures, including 3D models. I use it as the ultimate reference book to help you answer some of your finer anatomical questions. The author is a sculptor but it's not just for sculptors despite what the title says.

**[Morpho Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1681983745)**, *Michel Lauricella*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/morpho.jpg" alt="Morpho" width="280px"/>

The Morpho series (originally in French) is one of the most popular series of book on drawing. Most of them deal with anatomy with a few exceptions (most of which we will see below). I often see people recommend these for beginners but I think they're decently tough for beginners because you have to understand the simplification that the author makes and you need some experience to appreciate them. Still, it's fantastic and you should definitely get them. The thumbnail only shows the first book but there are many of them.

**[Anatomy for Artists: Drawing Form & Pose](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Artists-ultimate-perspective-tomfoxdraws-ebook/dp/B0D64J5W99)**, *Tom Fox*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/fox.jpg" alt="Fox" width="280px"/>

Tom Fox is a pretty well known artist (especially on social media) and this is his approach to anatomy. There are a variety of lessons on different topics with tips and tricks and many good pictures (hehe, old men). In general, the drawings are very "fleshy" for lack of a better term. Good stuff.

**[Stonehouse's Anatomy Note](https://superanius.com/products/stonehouse-anatomy-note)**, *Jeonghyun Seok*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/stonehouse.jpg" alt="Stonehouse" width="280px"/>

Considered by some to be kind of a final boss of anatomy. Honestly, it's very thick and I haven't been able to learn much from it yet because it's just above my paygrade, but it's legendary for a reason. The drawings are insane and you can tell the author understands anatomy in and out.

**[Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing From Life](https://www.amazon.com/Bridgmans-Complete-Guide-Drawing-Life/dp/1454926538)**, *George B. Bridgman*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/bridgman.jpg" alt="Bridgman" width="280px"/>

Is there a more famous anatomy book than this? Bridgman is feared by many and for good reason, it takes a lot of time to digest it. In fact, it's so well-known in the community that famous art instructors such as Alain Watts and Proko have spent time explaining how exactly to study from Bridgman. The general way people use this book is by copying it cover to cover twice, the first time with the references in front of them. I'm not there yet, but Bridgman's influence extends everywhere when it comes to illustrations so it's kind of a rite of passage, I guess.

**[Strength Training Anatomy](https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Training-Anatomy-Frederic-Delavier/dp/1718214863)**, *Frédéric Delavier*

<img src="/learn-drawing/img/delavier.jpg" alt="Delavier" width="280px"/>

This might seem like a bit of a weird addition. This is very clearly a book about strength training, so why is it here? Well, the anatomical drawings are just fantastic. This book has been praised by many artists for a good reason. Good stuff, especially if you like to draw muscular bodies.
